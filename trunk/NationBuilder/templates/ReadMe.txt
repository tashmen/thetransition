Current Directory layout:

administration - contains all templates related to administration of the site
events - Contains all templates related to events pages
theme - Contains all templates that can be downloaded from NationBuilder site using theme download
user - Contains all templates related to user pages


When uploading files to the nationbuilder test server you'll want to rename the non-common files mentioned below; you can add a suffix with your name or initials or nationbuilder id.  You will then need to use the filename chosen when deploying all of the test pages as templates onto the nationbuilder server.  This step is only required if you wish to make custom changes to the javascript files otherwise you can use the items off any of the other configured php servers.

Files to be modified with your php server location:
theme/_thetransitionextheader.html
theme/_thetransitionglobaluser.html
